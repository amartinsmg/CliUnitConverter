This is a personal project for a command line interface unit converter. It's made using Pascal language and can convert units of length, area, volume, mass, pressure, time, speed, acceleration, force, temperature, energy, and power.

To compile the program use this command:

make
```

<sub>**Note**: Before compiling, make sure you have installed [Free Pascal Compiler](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Installing_the_Free_Pascal_Compiler) and its [cross-compiling](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Cross_compiling).</sub>

To compile and run the tests, use these commands:
